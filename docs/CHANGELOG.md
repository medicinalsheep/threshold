# Changelog

## 10.0.0 — Blank grid rebuild

Focused, smaller default experience. Capabilities (multiplayer, agents, compiler, export, plugins) remain — the **default path** is simpler.

### For users
- **Default world** — blank grid; no bundled showcase props or low-quality starter meshes
- **Host-first lobby** — CREATE SESSION is the primary entry; offline play under "Offline & options"
- **Progressive UI** — scene dock, Compiler, and PromptGen unlock as you build (not shown on day one)
- **Scene dock** — collapse now hides the entire panel; **SCENE** tab on the right edge restores it
- **Removed from default** — Wardenclyffe showcase, survival tour, guided walkthrough on first visit

### Still available
- Multiplayer (PeerJS host/join/spectate)
- Compiler, PromptGen, AI agents (when unlocked or via host session)
- Export pipeline, store scripts, GIMP/Blender plugins (see `docs/`)
- TC Circuit demo (lobby → Offline & options)

### Developers
- Starter scene modules no longer imported at engine boot (smaller initial bundle)
- New: `src/shared/starterGrid.js`, `src/shared/progressiveUi.js`
- Version bump: `10.0.0`
