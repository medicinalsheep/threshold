# Polish Roadmap — Sprints K onward (v9.0+)

**Current:** v9.0.0 — guided PLAY/BUILD session, showcase gateway, survival vitals (Sprint J), collab guardrails (H–I), export & MP foundation (E–G).

**North star:** First impression reads as a **curated game-creation studio**, not a block sandbox — every default surface teaches a shippable feature.
